\begin{document}
I've built a rotary encoder and can read the state well. Without the arm/weight, I have gotten feedback control to move a wheel 180 degrees. I have built a single pendulum and am currently doing the controls for the pendulum with the swingup. I am currently reasoning about how well model parameters need to be measured/estimated and how to robustly deal with unmodeled dynamics.

A restriction from the hardware is that the motor is nonideal and has internal friction. The static friction is probably going to be more annoying than the kinetic friction to deal with.
