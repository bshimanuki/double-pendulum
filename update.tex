\begin{document}
I've written out the manipulator equations for the double pendulum, linearized it about the $q=(\pi,0)$ fixed point, and have simulations for LQR and the swing up controller. Parts have been ordered, and I've begun designing the parts. From the microcontroller side, I've used feedback control on a couple of simple plants, both with and without PWM signals.

I'm expecting that this will be a lot of work, but it is my highest priority project. Things so far have been mostly on schedule, maybe slightly behind.
